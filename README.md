# contacts(java)
This is my Data Structure final assignment, an address book,it use single linked list(by Java program language).
It's so easy that only have 1159 lines of code.
It contains feautres that check,add,dial,alter and delete.
It uses the MVC design pattern.
It uses easy file access instead of database.
